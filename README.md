# CTA-Data-Regression-Analysis

This repository is a work-in-progress. The final version will include different regression techniques
for analyzing the relationship between CTA ridership data and air quality in the Greater
Chicago Area. Currently the project contains one jupyter notebook for pre-processing and plotting
the CTA data. There will be another notebook for pre-processing and plotting the air quality data
and yet another notebook for running the regressings (OLS, Ridge and Lasso.) The notebooks should 
open in the browser and show the data. If not, one must download ipython and jupyter notebook to run
the notebook(s).
